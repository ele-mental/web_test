[ W H O _ W E _ A R E ]

ele_mental has encompassed the interests of artists, musicians, listeners, DJs, dancers, promoters, experimenters, and many others along the way. while many of the founders have come and gone, a few of us have stayed around long enough to welcome new people into the foldâ€”whether their contribution is merely as an audience member, an affiliated friend, an occasional helper, or a full-fledged participant helping chart new directions for the collective to go.

below is merely a suggestive list charting some of the people who've been with us, and those of us who have stayed actively committed to the ele_mental name.
